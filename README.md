# Chat-Application

CHAT APPLICATION, gives the user the option to create a username
protected by a password stored in a map. After creating an account, the user can
initiate a conversation with another user, view the inbox to get all the messages,
add or delete a friend and start a group chat. Vectors are used for storing the friend
list.
The further modifications that can be introduced in the code are introducing file
handling to create a database and further strengthening the protection of the user
account by imposing certain limits on passwords (e.g. they must contain
minimum 8 characters with at least one upper case alphabet, one lower case
alphabet, one digit and one special character).
